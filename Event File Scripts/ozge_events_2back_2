% Events: nontarget trials as epoch: 1,2,3,4,5,6
%         target trials as epoch: 7,8,9
%         interepisodeintervals as epoch: 10
%         rests as epoch: 11
%         TRIALs: from one picture onset to the other, and for the last
%         trial from picture onset to the end of the response
%         IEI: from the response to the onset of the first trial; and for
%         the last episode there is no IEI
